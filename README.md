ðŸš— Project Overview â€“ Smart Automotive Order Management System

The Smart Automotive Order Management System is a Salesforce CRM-based solution developed to streamline and automate the vehicle sales process for automotive companies.
The project focuses on improving customer experience, dealer coordination, and inventory accuracy through intelligent automation and data-driven workflows.

In this system, vehicle details, stock availability, customer data, and dealer information are all stored and managed within Salesforce.
When a customer places an order, the system automatically validates stock levels, prevents orders for unavailable vehicles, and assigns the order to the nearest authorized dealer based on the customerâ€™s location.

It also includes scheduled automation using Batch Apex and Scheduled Apex to periodically update order statuses â€” automatically changing them from Pending to Confirmed once stock is replenished.
This ensures real-time transparency, minimizes manual intervention, and enhances operational efficiency.

By leveraging Salesforce features like Custom Objects, Record-Triggered Flows, Apex Triggers, and Batch Jobs, this project successfully integrates business logic with CRM automation.
Overall, the Smart Automotive Order Management System represents a digital transformation initiative for the automotive industry â€” delivering faster order processing, better accuracy, and an enhanced customer experience.
