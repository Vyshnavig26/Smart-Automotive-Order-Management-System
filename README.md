# Smart-Automotive-Order-Management-System

# Project Overview

The Smart Automotive Order Management System is a Salesforce CRM-based solution designed to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency in the automotive sector.
The system integrates vehicle inventory, dealer management, customer data, and automated order processing to create a unified and intelligent platform.

Using Salesforce automation tools such as Flows, Apex Triggers, and Batch Apex, the system ensures that customers can only place orders for vehicles in stock and automatically assigns each order to the nearest dealer based on the customer’s location.

Additionally, the project includes scheduled automation that updates order statuses based on stock availability — orders automatically move from Pending to Confirmed once the stock is replenished.
Overall, this implementation enables WhatNext Vision Motors to deliver faster, error-free, and more transparent order processing.
